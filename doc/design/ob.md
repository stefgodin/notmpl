# What is Output Buffering?

[PHP Output Buffering](https://www.php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.user-level-output-buffers.php){_target="blank"} is a 
mechanism that allows you to capture and manipulate output generated by PHP scripts before it is sent to the browser.
This functionality is particularly useful when you want to store generated HTML content in a variable for later use,
manipulate the output, or prevent content from being sent prematurely.

## How to use it?

1. `ob_start()` to start output buffering
2. Output (echo) your html and/or text
3. `ob_get_clean()` to end output buffering and return the buffer value

```php
    <?php ob_start(); ?>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Output Buffering</title>
        </head>
        <body>Hello, World!</body>
    </html>
   <?php
   $output = ob_get_clean(); // Contains the whole HTML as a string
```

## How is it related to NoTMPL?

Output buffering provides a flexible way to manipulate and control output in PHP scripts, enabling tasks like template
processing.

The NoTMPL engine simply uses output buffering to control content echoed between its tag and then builds a tree of tag
with their respective content. The tree can then be processed and reworked to display only the parts needed and merge
others according to its internal logic.
